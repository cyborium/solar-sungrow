# Sungrow Monitor
A python 3.x script to allow direct monitoring of sungrow inverters over LAN TCP modbus connections and upload the averaged observations for a specified interval to pvoutput.org

Based on a cut down version of [Meltaxa's solarIoT script](https://github.com/meltaxa/solariot) please check out their work if you are interested in a full on prememsis solution.

The modbus map was generated from the official sungrow modbus specification and contains many commented out registers. These are present simply as a register index to make it easier for anyone else that is looking for the information to get ahold of it as it was not openly avialble when I began this project. Only active power is required for the upload to pvoutput.

A docker container is available at [thomasfa18/solar-sungrow](https://hub.docker.com/r/thomasfa18/solar-sungrow) for a click and run solution.

## Getting Started - DIY
- Clone the repository to a directory eg ./app
- Install python 3.x and pip
  - `apt-get update && apt-get -y install curl python python-pip`
- Install the required python modules
  - `pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt`
- Create a config.py that matches your environment in the same directory as the sungrow_monitor.py script
- Run the script, it will spit out messages to stdout every scan interval
  - `python sungrow_monitor.py`
  
## Getting Started - Docker
- Configure a directory for the config file [config.py] and modbus map if you have a custom one [modbus-<customename>.py]
- Create a config.py based off the example that matches your environment and place it in the config directory
  - `docker pull thomasfa18/solar-sungrow`
- Download the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/thomasfa18/solar-sungrow)
- Run the docker image with the volume switch to mount your config directory as /config in the image
  - `docker run -v <localpath>:/config thomasfa18/solar-sungrow`

  - This has been tested on a a sungrow SG5K-D inverter only
  - A list of "valid devices" is included at the top of the modbus map, this came from the sungrow modbus specification document directly. It may work with other devices, I do not know.
  - The script only performs reads of the input registers (function code 04), if you do not know anything about modbus I would highly dicourage you from making changes.
  - In short, you are welcome to use this, but if you do you are agreeing that if something bad happens then it was not my fault and you can't sue me.
